This tutorial has the following:

	1. A testJDBC file that I coded just to test a vanilla JDBC coonection. I am using Java 8.

	2. Then there is also a Student class where I have used the Hibernate annotations to specify the Object Relation Mapping with the databse. \ Student is a POJO that maps to the student table in my database. Performed the CRUD operations. In the CreateStudentDemo, I created a student object and then using Hibernate stored it in the Database. Then with the ReadStudentDemo, I read the object with using Hibernate. Then also tried my hands with Delete and Update. Futhermore, wrote some HQL too. Like, retrieving all the students from the database as a list, Retrieving students with lastName as "Doe", Retrieve students using OR predicate, retrieving students using LIKe predicate.
